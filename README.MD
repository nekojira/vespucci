WordPress has really nice and robust frameworks for ecommerce, social networking, meta data organization, events management, forms management, and many more... Why can't we have one for geolocation and maps? 

This plugin is an attempt to build a better framework to manage things like geo spatial coordinates, geolocation, location queries, locations to WordPress objects relationships, custom maps, all within WordPress, combined with Leaflet.js and external map tile provides (Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenStreetMaps, etc.).

At the core, it should allow users to store point coordinates and attach these to existing WordPress objects (namely posts, taxonomy terms, users, comments), perform geo spatial queries and output results on customizable maps. It aims to be modular and extensible, to make it play nicely with other plugins or external services and let people build extensions or addons for it.
